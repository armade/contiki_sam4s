contiki_sam4s
============================
This is a hobby project. Use with caution :)

The project incorporates support for the sam4s chip from Microchip(Atmel). The radio link is done over an AT86RF231 using the USARTâ€™s spi interface. The USB interface enumerates as two ttyACM, where port0 is a SLIP interface and PORT1 can be used for debugging (PRINTF).
